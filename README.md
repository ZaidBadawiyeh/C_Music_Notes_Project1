# Expanding on my C++ Experience

The code stored within this repository is an example of some C++ work I completed during my first coding course at the University of Colorado Boulder.
The code focusses on music, using C++ to loop through strings and disect them to determine if they are proper notes and tunes that you would find
in a sheet of music. Beyond this, the "similarity" script aims to detemine how different musical tunes compare to each other by assigning a 
mathematically derived score to tune similarity. While this code is still very much basic, it is included in my portfolio as an example of the first
real-world coding scenarios I engaged in. While previous worked focussed on the fundamentals of programming structures, the work here showcases the
ability to solve real questions and make applicable programs that can solve problems.
